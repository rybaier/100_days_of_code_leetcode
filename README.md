# 100 Days of code Log Round 2
Didn't make it far last time before having to break the streak. This year I am going to complete 100 days of code, specifically LeetCode problems

## Day 1 - 1/2/23
Started the LeetCode 75 Interview Question prep. Today's problem was to merge strings alternately. I used javascript to solve this problem writing a series of conditionals with nested loops. First I split each word into a seperate array and then pushed each index of the array in alteranting order until both words were finished

## Day 2
 today's leetcode was the Greatest Common Divisor of strings. I attempted several approaches and it took me longer than I would have liked but I got there in the end after finally resorting reading the editorial and discussions before coming up with an answer that was acceptable. I first spent time trying to run the answer with regular expression matching but it wasn't good for all test cases. The next approach was a combination of arrays and string methods and conditional operators I was much closer with this but it still failed about 20% of the test cases. I finally came around to a simple math method with a for loop that passed all test cases though the memory usage was high.

## Day 3 
have you ever made a problem over complicated that's what I spent over 2 hrs doing with todays problem. spent way more time chasing certain ideas down the line when in reality do not have a solution that passes all test cases. Will work again on it tomorrow, I spent way too long on this

## Day 4
fnished yesterday's problem after some thoughts overnight. I also completed today's problem called kids with the greatest number of candies. This time instead of trying to code first I handwrote it out then pseudocoded it then went about writing the code to complete it. it went a lot faster than yesterday

 - lines 209 - 379 are the problem I struggled with
 - lines 380 - 408
 - Jan 5

 ## Day 5 
  today's leetcode problem was to reverse all the vowels in a string.

 - lines 410 - 437

 ## Day 6 
 reverse all the words in a string, make sure there are no extra spaces

## Day 8 
a problem that gave me some difficulty after solving it once but not in the proper time complexity. I had to research what I was missing to find the mathmatical algorithum to get it to the correct time complexity.

## Day 9 
a problem I vastly overcomplicated for far too long and in the end found a simple solution
 - lines 525 -636
 - https://github.com/rybaier/100-days-of-code/blob/master/js%20playground/index.js 
 - Jan 9

## Day 10
 a moderate problem, I understood the necessary logic and wrote it out on paper. Implenting the code took a while and I had trouble trying to reduce the code to what I knew it could be.  continually getting endless loops until I got the correct set of conditions
 - lines 638 - 694
 - https://github.com/rybaier/100-days-of-code/blob/master/js%20playground/index.js 
 - Jan 10

 ## Day 11 
 an easy problem that I spent time trying to reduce my total number of operations. The solution that I ended with while 2 operations seems the best for any testcase I could think of.

 ## Day 12 
 easier problem today, wrote it in pen first then typed it out. Had to rearrange where I put the inrement after i reached a false test case and then it passed all
 - lines 724 -763

 - Jan 12

 ## Day 13 
 This one came easily again writing my thoughts in pen first helped me work the code out much faster
  - lines 765-795
 - https://github.com/rybaier/100-days-of-code/blob/master/js%20playground/index.js 
 - Jan 13

  ## Day 13 
I had the concept right but I got stuck trying to implement it with a while loop. Once I figured out to use a hashmap for keeping track it worked out much better

## Day 14 
Easier problem today, maximum average with a sliding window
 - lines  856 - 874
 - https://github.com/rybaier/100-days-of-code/blob/master/js%20playground/index.js 
 - Jan 15

 ## Day 15 
a sliding window for consecutive vowels medium level took a bit of time
 - lines  876 - 903
 - https://github.com/rybaier/100-days-of-code/blob/master/js%20playground/index.js 
 - Jan 16

## Day 16 
max consecutive 1's sliding window medium level took less time than yesterday
 - lines 905-926
 - https://github.com/rybaier/100-days-of-code/blob/master/js%20playground/index.js 
 - Jan 17
 
 ## Day 17
 longest subarray of 1's sliding window used a similary approach as yesterday

 - Jan 18

## Day 18
 did  a problem on codewars today instead for generating hashtags. I ended up on codewars randomly and the problem looked fun. I solved it once then refactored it to 3 lines

## Day 19
 easier problem today. did a second.

## Day 20
a new problem type involving Sets

 - https://github.com/rybaier/100-days-of-code/blob/master/js%20playground/index.js

 ## Day 21
this problem required both a Hashmap and a Set to solve
