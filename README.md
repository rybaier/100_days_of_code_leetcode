# 100 Days of code Log Round 2
Didn't make it far last time before having to break the streak. This year I am going to complete 100 days of code, specifically LeetCode problems

## Day 1 - 1/2/23
Started the LeetCode 75 Interview Question prep. Today's problem was to merge strings alternately. I used javascript to solve this problem writing a series of conditionals with nested loops. First I split each word into a seperate array and then pushed each index of the array in alteranting order until both words were finished

## Day 2
 today's leetcode was the Greatest Common Divisor of strings. I attempted several approaches and it took me longer than I would have liked but I got there in the end after finally resorting reading the editorial and discussions before coming up with an answer that was acceptable. I first spent time trying to run the answer with regular expression matching but it wasn't good for all test cases. The next approach was a combination of arrays and string methods and conditional operators I was much closer with this but it still failed about 20% of the test cases. I finally came around to a simple math method with a for loop that passed all test cases though the memory usage was high.

## Day 3 
have you ever made a problem over complicated that's what I spent over 2 hrs doing with todays problem. spent way more time chasing certain ideas down the line when in reality do not have a solution that passes all test cases. Will work again on it tomorrow, I spent way too long on this

## Day 4
fnished yesterday's problem after some thoughts overnight. I also completed today's problem called kids with the greatest number of candies. This time instead of trying to code first I handwrote it out then pseudocoded it then went about writing the code to complete it. it went a lot faster than yesterday
